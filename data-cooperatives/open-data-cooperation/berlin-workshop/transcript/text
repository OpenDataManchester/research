Notes from Berlin meeting

Frank Kresin Waag Society
Marcos Menendez - The Good Data
Christof Hanzelmen - Not much into open data yet. Drupal consulting company working on open source project that enables people to create social objects around internets - Belgium
Ben Webb
Robin Gower
Steven Flower
Reuben Binns - researcher 1) How can  companies convince a sceptical privacy fanatic to give their data not user / member 2) Decision support for product and choices based on ethics rather than money
Annemarie Naylor - Associated director at Locality transfer buildings to communities. Creation social assets but this could be data. Looking at integrating Hacker Spaces into Libraries. Working with 3rd sector orbs how do they compete. 3rd sector orbs not being able to capitalise on their data assets but not coherent. Intermediaries not making money. Improve the position of not for profit orgs. Audit of organisation who have children centre who aren’t able to use own data
Mark Braggins - least knowledgeable on the scene. Is there an open data coop as distinct from a data coop. Organisation focus. Has partnership board and how do others outside public sector contribute.
Alex Fink into grow the space to be political participants. Police interventions in communities of colour in Minnesota. Power of open data being used against poor communities. Towards justice and equity

CH - Are there any examples of open data cooperatives already in existence? Are there any that are already generating value. Open Street Map is run by a foundation. Are there any examples such as OSM
JT- Open Street Map originally more like a coop due to its licensing agreements.
MM - Health Bank is an example. Swiss cooperative. I think one of the ideas is that the data is shared for scientific data. That is the plan
FK - Does it just take a group of people trying to do something together to be a cooperative? Or is there a value exchange between a common cooperative.
CH - I guess a coop is legally a coop and therefore there are legal requirements for that.
SF - There are many different formats for a cooperative, a workers coop, a producers coop, consumer coop -There are many different involvements around data and open data. You could be producing it , using it, analysing it, monetising it in some cases. This is where the conversations stalled as there are lots of different coops. Haven’t seen any compelling cases
AN - It is worth not starting at the governance arrangements this is what you apply to your mission. It should be why are we doing it? Why is it worth sharing data and in what ways is it not being shared now that would be useful and then you apply the governance. Form follows function so the governance model will follow whether you are trying to make money out of the data. Is somebody else trying to make money out of us and we need to share the proceeds of together. You start with the mission and I think it something missing from the open data debate at the moment. I sit on LGDP and the advise there is give it away. Give it to private sector. As the argument is about economic growth. Why are we giving away public data assets and we are largely giving away factual information about maps… Or we give away poor peoples’ data as most of the state mechanism is for the provision of services to the poor. So it affects disproportionally. For the first time the poor person for the first time has an asset and they shouldn’t have to give it away for the benefit of the 1% - well that is my theory. So I sit in the open data meetings and say these assets you are amassing  belong to people who if they cooperated maybe could have more say in the services that they receive. Have greater choices about who or where there provision comes from. But to me the coop concept is a pain in the ass for me and it separate and it is just something that people get as a name and a concept.
RG - Rochdale Pioneers. Equity and ownership of the asset is shared amongst that group of people. If you look to examples of where you get cooperation over open data and it has a completely different structure and you get something called Mydex. Are you familyar with Doc Searles free play manifesto, project VRM. Where we all have our personal data stores and then collectively able to bargain for services. Essentially it is collaborative
AN - Playing devils advocate. There is a slightly nuanced point there is a scale on ways in which you can govern something its purely state??? Its for public benefit/charitable right down to CIC like Mydex which is nice for the directors but it instils a market instinct around personal data. Indy tech Summit - Thing is there steeling our data and its ours and we want it back. That’s nice, let’s all be owners of our houses and data assets. But there is not a mission that states all of this … because?
MM - When set up good data we set a very ambitious mission. Which is about taking ownership of your data. In order to be open, first you have to own it. Public administration can be open because they have the data. The problem with the citizen is that they don’t have the data, or they don’t have the access or ownership. It is really their but its in Facbooks hands, Googles hands etc. So the first objective to be open is first to own it. To be aware of what data that you produce and to be in control of the settings if you want to keep it private you can if you want to share you can. So if a citizen says that they want to keep the data so it can be used for public benefit. So the cooperative will help you do that. So mtg simple decision is that I will only give away data if they pay for that and we as an intermediary help you maximise that revenue. This is an individual decision that can only happen if you are the owner.
JT - Economics - single data points are valueless
MM - Regarding the economics historically there were three  factors of production. Land(Assets), labour and capital. If we have good ideas we can get capital. The economy won’t be driven by labour and capital but by data and ideas in the future. So we as people have to be sure that we own that data as it is our source of wealth in the future. In the network the wealth is going to the big nodes that know how to exploit the scale of data production. In the further we will not work because the algorithms and robots will be working for us. WE have to be sure as a society as we have to make sure that we control data.
AN - I disagree. I’m not sure what you think of the value of data?
JT Economics but the data as aggregated is valuable. My interest is how we can pool data and negotiate our data for our communities and ourselves
RG - Vendor relationship management instead of customer relationship management that it turns on its head is that you come together collectively. Like when you download and an app and you set the permissions to allow or deny. That is the idea of the personal datastore. So the relationship you can have is that I will tell an app about my gender, if it will let me know where the nearest app would be. That is all well and good but it is completely a parallel universe and wondering if the was an organisation that is big enough. How would this happen
JT - Legislation and statute has a place but that is a long way off. Was looking at citizen.me but it has no power. It has no power to broker with Facebook or Google. Example of Chromaroma were people pooling thier data broke the T&Cs of Tfl. IN 2005 there was an organisation called the Attention Trust and the principals were quite interesting because it was how do you rest back attention. Around that time there were discussions of the attention economy idea. All websites wanted to grab attention. [READS principles] Transfer data for attention. But ultimately you might find that this doesn’t work for the same reasons.
CH - Bigger than our existing data. Would it be possible to create a silicon valley coop. That would be the next Facebook? How would it look like
MM - This is the best thing about the sharing economy AN - Renting - MM - You are creating a lot of value like Airbnb etc. You are creating a lot of value as a customer but you are not getting any of that, which is a bit unfair. But on the other side we can  as people fund companies such as through crowd funding. I think with data it something that is good for both things as it can create value as it an asset that can be used and create value for you or on your behalf also it is an asset that can fund. Data is an asset that you can co-create and co-fund/crowd fund. It is a perfect example of ways of building cooperation. In the future $billion companies with 13 employees is not fair because those employees are not so intelligent to make 400 million per employee as an individual. It is not so complex. The value is on the have x million customers. All the value is in the customer.
CH - CVBA (Belgian name) Coops can Special belgian forum. king sets the terms of return on investment that is fair. That is given to the organisations and the people who have invested in the coop. A few large orbs donating a whole lot of cash. It is set at a maximum of 6% per year as fair reward for capital. So you can make a coop were the investors get a money back from their investment but the people have say in how that is organised. So Occulus Rift raises a ton of cash through crowd funding and sells to face book and what
They get billions and the original investors get tee shirts
AN - It goes back to a basic question. I am going to be realiy sexist and as the only girl in the room. You can just get a tax accountant as it is more efficient. You are talking a lot about how but not why. If you tread on a grasshopper etc. The question is why do we care about pooling our data. One mission could be to empower people to choose, believing in democracy and believing that everyone has a right to wine their data a mantra left of Stalin so I don’t believe that is the best outcome. Building communities around particular issues that have context such as rare illness. No private sector org would be interested but if there is enough you might be able to pool resources that might be of interest. Suxh as by sharing your medical data. it is nothing to do with finance, it is do with your kids are going to get the treatment they need. There is a bunch of different questions about why you would pool data. It is interesting why you would pool flooding data, environmental data etc. But domestic violence data? Why would a women invest in giving over the data to a centre where she ran from her husband at night. Why would she want to invest that? It is because she wants there to be a service in future that is better. I don’t want money or choice, I want to share because someone gave me an opportunity to benefit from my data assets and nobody even asked me. So Facebook and Google are interested in private value of middle class white people who will buy their products. Where as deprived communities there is a different value. You say (JT) there is very little value of an individuals data I think that is rubbish. Where you have a state intervention costing a disproportionate to the state your data is invaluable - who cares about the rest. You could save a fortune in government terms if you had access to their data.  So cooperative of the most complex needs people could infinitely more valuable for the state not to Facebook or Google. So if you did a grid of whose data is valuable to whom and in what way and what mission are we serving y- is it something about choice, its about services. It would be a bit more subtle than sharing and extraction. The extraction is sometimes shared value, public value.
RB - You say that individuals data isn’t valuable to FB or Google but it is to Wonga. I think the way to approach it is to think about the incentives, what and why.
AN - You make a good point. Should we be empowering people who are exploited by these people first. If we have a mission rather than just selling and for what. So you are replicating what we have had for a few hundred years and now we are looking at how you can apply that. Instead of I want my data because it is not fair.
RB - Personal data empowerment isn’t just about selling data to the highest bidder
AN - How do we choose.
MB - Empowering people who were mostly likely to get fucked. These are the people who would be most vulnerable as they need the service and readily exploited
AN - The people taking their data are predominantly the state and they are not paying for it and they are giving it to private organisations to make money for the 1% so there is a nasty flow of value to someone else. which I believe is obnoxious. Which is different to MM proposition
MM - My proposition is about helping people to enjoy their ownership of their data. You can enjoy it by earning some money or doing some good to the public sector. If the data is valuable if it only 100 people agree that the data would be valuable if it is ver y niche. But in order to have those niches you have to have a big volume of data. Because data brokers want lots, to have 200 you need to have 1 million and that is a big challenge of a data coop. There are data brokers such as Experian. They only start talking to you if you have 500,000.
AN - Because they are selling to private sector advertisers.
MM - I go to health ministry then you have to have 1 million people to have a statistically relevant amount of people. This is a big challenge, this is why The Good Data is focussing on a very simple marketing approach. Has to be very simple and very lean to build;d volume.
CH – This is really important. Governance and how do you incentivise. Was at a meet up for business leaders in the Drupal community and so I was saying do you want to part of my coop and there was a few who wanted to know the benefits such as what am I going to earn and looking for the financial plan. Several of them just wanted to buy the service and didn't want to deal with the hassle. This is the barrier to overcome because few of the memebers would be sufficiemtly engaged to take over the burdon of governance and the responsibility of governce. There is an implied duty with in the coop model. That you need to remember.
JT – Essentially cooperatives become out of opporational efficiency tend towards pyramid structures. They don't maintain flatness all the way along. Because some engage and others don't. Because of the nature of all ventures there are natural leaders at the start.
RB – A lot of the people don't engage got involved because they aligned with the people who started off to begin with.
JT – This is what I find interesting. The notion of – does this align with what I want to happen with my assets because data is an asset. I chose to give or don't give.
AN – It could also be a liability as well which worth thinking about as well. Whose data has liability – in what context
CH – You keep talking about data as people. I understand this is an important case but I think it is much bigger than that. Wikipedia could have been a coop. But it could of made financial benefit to someone. But is actually a foundation that might be similar to a coop.
I am looking at how are we going to build the next wikipedia.
You crowdsource the creation of a data asset and can that be a coop. You can make it.
AN – If you say that you can make $10 they might say no but if you say that you are going to change the world you might do. I can only give it to you so I am giving exclusive rights. I can't give it to everyone. You give it to google because you like their service.
RG – This is the problem. WE give it away without realising and we give it away for free and we give it away to a monopoly and feeding the means by which the world gets all its information. Facebook at valuation was worth $2 for each account. Google makes $3 per month
AN – Why would you bother with data coops rather than lobbying government and teaching people about data literacy
MM – It is about choice.
AN – WE are talking about data politics and it sounds too geeky but this is what data politics is about
RG – Discussions In alternate social network space. If you look at diaspora you connect to pods and these connect to other pods. It is sort of like a coop. But you can get a crazy open access environment but there is no data being transferred
AN – These choices are not there for 95% of the people out there. You couldn't sell this to someone trying to get in touch with their grand son I don't like the way the indy tech sector is not trying design something because it is ethical it is doing it to out compete. I want to allow people to learn and be educated aboput this stuff
BW – Building distributed and federated systems is difficult, centralised systems are easiest and thats why they persist and then you get the network effect. Can we make the federated distribution system better.
AN – Looking at stack. The options are to become Luddite. How do we reintroduce ethics into the discussion that is taking place. It is not about choice it is about ethical power.
JT – Not everyone aligns to the same goals perhaps.
AN – Terms and condition, how do you create an environment for people to participate
RG – Practical principles for a data coop. Don't require exclusivity and EULA.
AN – It is discussion about ethics. Who cares
MM – I think the data coop can't expect to deliver a great service. I think service has to be developed by Zuckerberg. I don't think we can do that. You have to split the service layer from the data layer. You control the data layer and then you can choose who builds the service layer. I think that makes sense.
CH- I think OSM is doing that to a certain extent. It is effectively owned by the community. BW - The reason that works is that it is open license. As soon as it is closed you get leakage. I want you to use my service but I don't want you to leak the data. There might be a contract etc.
RG – Copy left is the only way that we are going to be able to lose IPR but still be protected from the mega corps. The open source mvement and all the repositories is like the biggest data coop that the planet has ever seen. And people contribute due to the licensing environment that has created the willingness for people to share. It doesn't make a lot of sense but that uploading a few photos to Facebook is giving away my data, but everyoine else is tagging my photos and then the data becomes aggregate. This is a nightmare scenario. This is something that the OS movement had and insight into that.
RB – ORG and OKF are working on the idea of a personal data license. It has been done in a lot of guises
JT - What is the effacacy?
RB – I thimnk the model is a contract basis but has the problems of if you don't trust then it fails.
CH – Funny things about OS is that the main company is a private company – RG – on Git not Github – CH – There is a lot of stuff.
AF – Only big because it is in San Francisco and it holds huge parties, it is a big private organisation that plays like a public one. It is a public service and people use it as a public service.
MM – Good for them. I don't believe that OS coders build code for nothing. The Good Data is OS. If you build something connected you get money. If you add value you get money.
CH – In the Drupal community we have had this discussion. With people giving up their jobs.
JT – Cooperatives are federated. They align because ultimately there is commonality.
CH – I believe that cooperatives do have a commonality, such as they align because it is good for the world.
RB – I don't know whether that is the case. A workers coop might have small membership but larger service coops are huge and where is the automatic commonality. It doesn't.
AN – MM has set up a particular kind of coop.
MM – We are an IPS not a CIC. I talked to Coops UK and they said 'go for that' They said one person per vote and there is a way to bring in financial support and there is a way to have private investment. Good Data has 4 members because it is in private beta.
JT – If I bestow my data do I become a member?
MM – No, we need data volume and you need to download a plug in. If you decide to become a member then you have to register.
AN – If you have an easy to understand fucntion i.e. google search then it is easy for people to sign up.
MM – If you become a member then you enter all your data. Then we sell a share.
AN – There is an issue on how you scale when it is open.
MM – After a certain amount of time we delete the data
FK – How can you sell the data if you delete it?
MM – At this point because we don't have volume what we can sell is recent and currnet data. So we sell search type etc.
AN – What you are demonstrating is a work in progress.
JT – Tallking to community broadband providers in Italy and some have incorporated in to coops and some haven't incorporated at all because they didn't want to face the liability and be sued.
AN – Digital Methyr, helped the community built their data mesh network. This was a good idea where they enabled people to spend £50 to put in their own equipment but ultimately it wasn't owned by anyone.
JT – We often get fixated by formal structure whereas sometimes it is appropriate to not be formalised.
AN – The thing about cooperatives is that it is universally understood.
MM – TGD is incorporated and has limited liability where members have to pay 1 pence per share.
CH – There is liability within the first two years in some countries. I have been thinking of Bitcoin to distribute value and ownership through an organisation. Coloured Coins – you define a certain range of currency that you use in your economy and you define their value above and beyond Bitcoin and how much more valuable depends on how well the economy is doing. Thinking about creating an economy where people join and create services to that network and join the economy and create value within that.
RG – Same thing happens with Letts. If you limit the scale and scope of your economy, you limit what members do exist  and what they spend their money on.
CH – This is OK. From Drupal there is a problem where we have lots of people contributing and not alwayds getting money for what they are doing, whereas there are some companies earning shit loads of money. They get reputational cred which can increase chances of getting money – AN
RG – This is a non zoo perspective of social enterprise. There is a spectrum from charity that is vision driven to corporate enterprise that is purely money driven. There are several legal structures to help this.
JT – Can you have hybrid structures
RG – You can. It is what you can mix.
AN – Michel Bouwens and the P2P consortium has come up with Open Coops, the FLOCK society project etc . Really interesting is DAOs Distributed autonomous organisations. Take Bitcoin infographic and make micor librarians who exchange knowledge for money.
RG – A bit like mechanical turk
RB – A bit like the Chinese Flesh search where people would post on a social network and ask where is this place and people would go out and try and find it.
AN – Search for the best person who can ask the question. You cant get all human knowledge in the block chain but you can use swarm and the human search.
JT – You can run the risk of the long tail of knowledge is worth more than other and that is problematic you have alternative currencies whether it be knowledge or things where things have more value. Problem with closed currencies is that at some point it breaks down on the interface. Where it has to negotiate with something that is more concrete and that is why we have money.
AN – It is a store of wealth, with Michel Bauwens we have been talking about Open Coops that have an inbuilt asset lock. Where after a certain time value/wealth gets realised. What is the ultimate anti asset lock is the state. You could recreate the state outside by creating alternative 'block chain vehicles'. There are all kinds of ways that coops can exist as a distributed autonomous communities. Where people accept something for themselves and donate the rest to the coop.
RG – Sounds like Liquid Democracy
AN – This creates a rule based democracy that allows you to participate and switch between different DAOs
CH – You can choose what you live in but you can't really. By choosing where you live you can choose what economy that you live in and you want.
RB – Beginning to sound like Elon Musks idea of a floating island.
MM – Regarding pulling together BitCoin and data coops, there is one VC, the only one I agreeed to talk to called Frank Wilson. He talked about decentralised identity which talks about examples like NameCoin ID. I take my data and I don't mind where it is because it is decentralisd but I can take it back. I give you that data for a specific purpose. There is another one called the Respect network which is a linked to Doc Searle. You can always link to my data but I can always take it back
MB – It reminds me of social applications where you can grant or revoke access.
JT – The danger is popularism and difficult or strategic projects might not be supported and this is a difficulty with direct democracy and why we have advocacy in politics. We cede some of our power to allow advocates to make decisions on our behalf. Our data might be used for things I don't necessarily agree with but it is good for society.
RG – The liquid feedback system allows you to nominate people to vote on your behalf. And so you can create a system where you cede to certain experts and bestow and revoke.
RB – The original idea for something called platform preferences which is a W3 standard which never really took off, a lot of companies started doing it but realised it was too difficult. The idea was that you could create privacy poliicies that could be understood by browsers. But the original idea was more complex than that, individuals where able to set their own preferences and If you went to a website which didn't match it would show the conflicts. Original ideas was that most people don't or wouldbn't create their own settinsgs but the idea was that you chose the person who best reflected your position and you used their settings. Liquid feedback devolving to one person
MM – One person with reputation. It is good that we have built reputational people but offline it is easy to say I trust you, but online it Is difficult to trust.
JT – The idea that you select a certain celebrity type of settings is interesting Jeremy Clarkson
AN – The great discussion and the ethics discussion is a great and needs to be rekindled.
